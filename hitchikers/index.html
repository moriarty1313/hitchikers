	<div class="p p1 narrator">
		Against all probability, a sperm whale had suddenly been called into existence several miles above the surface of an alien planet.
	</div>
	

	<div class="p p2 narrator">
		Since this is not a naturally tenable position for a whale, this poor, innocent creature had very little time to come to terms with its identity as a whale before it then had to come to terms with not being a whale any more.
	</div>


	<div class="p p3 narrator">
		This is a complete record of its thoughts from the moment it began its life, till the moment it ended it.
	</div>


	<div class="p p4 whale">
		Ah...! What's happening? it thought.
		Er, excuse me, who am I?
	</div>


	<div class="p p5 whale">
		Hello?

	</div>


	<div class="p p6 whale">
		Why am I here? What's my purpose in life?
		What do I mean by who am I?
	</div>


	<div class="p p7 whale">
		Calm down, get a grip now...oh! this is an interesting sensation,what is it? 
	</div>

	<div class="p p8 whale">
		It's a sort of... yawning, tingling sensation in my... my... well I suppose I'd better start finding names for things if I want to make any headway in what for the sake of what I shall call an argument I shall call the world, so let's call it my stomach. 
	</div>

	<div class="p p9 whale">
		Good. Ooooh, it's getting quite strong. 
	</div>



	<div class="p p10 whale">
		And hey, what's about this whistling, roaring sound going past what I'm suddenly going to call my head? Perhaps I can call that... wind! 
	</div>

	<div class="p p11 whale">
		Is that a good name? 
	</div>

	<div class="p p12 whale">	
		It'll do... perhaps I can find a better name for it later when I've found out what it's for. 
	</div>


	<div class="p p13 whale">
		It must be something very important because there certainly seems to be a hell of a lot of it.
	</div>



	<div class="p p14 whale">
		Hey! What's this thing? This... let's call
		it a tail? yeah, tail.
	</div> 

	<div class="p p15 whale">
		Hey! I can really thrash it about pretty good can't I?
	</div>

	<div class="p p16 whale">
		Wow! Wow! That feels great! Doesn't seem to achieve very much but I'll probably find out what it's for later on.
	</div>



	<div class="p p17 whale">
		Now? have I built up any coherent pictures of things yet?
	</div>


	<div class="p p18 whale">
		No.
	</div>


	<div class="p p19 whale">
		Never mind, hey, this is really exciting, so much to find out about, I'm quite dizzy with anticipation...
	</div>

 
	<div class="p p20 whale">
		Or is it the wind?
		There really is a lot of that now isn't it?
	</div>


	<div class="p p21 whale">
		And wow! Hey! What's this thing suddenly coming towards me very fast? Very very fast.
	</div>


	<div class="p p22 whale">
		 So big and flat and round, it needs a big wide sounding name like... ow... ound... round... ground! That's it! That's a good name? ground!
	</div>


	<div class="p p23 whale">
		I wonder if it will be friends with me?
	</div>



	<div class="p p24 narrator">
		And the rest, after a sudden wet thud, was silence.
	</div>
